## Project Description

This repository implements a random string generation application. It leverages a Spring Boot 3 backend for generating random strings and an Angular 17 frontend for user interaction and displaying the generated strings.

## Key Technologies

* **Backend:** Spring Boot 3 (Java)
* **Frontend:** Angular 17 (TypeScript)
* **Version Control:** Git

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two distinct directories, each dedicated to a specific technology stack:

* **be-random-string-generator:** This directory houses all the backend code written in Java and utilizing Spring Boot 3 with JDK 17. It's responsible for the core logic of generating random strings.
* **fe-random-string-generator:** This directory contains the frontend code written in TypeScript and utilizing Angular 17 with Node.js 20.12.2. Its focus lies on the user interface, enabling interaction and display of the generated strings.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the application, follow these detailed steps:

**Prerequisites:**

- **Git:** Ensure you have Git installed on your system. You can download it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
